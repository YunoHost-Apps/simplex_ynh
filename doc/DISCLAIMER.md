### SMP server address

You can find the fingerprint in the SimpleX Chat service in the webadmin

Your SMP server address should look like this:

```
smp://YOUR_FINGERPRINT=@YOUR_IPV4_ADDRESS:5223
```

For mobile clients, open Settings, find an option "SMP servers", toggle "Configure SMP Servers" to on, then enter the SMP Servers Address for all servers you want the client to use.
